# adapt-contrib-drawerPageNavigation_Enhanced - Do not use! Work in progress!

Enhancement of Adapt2 extension that add a navigation element to the drawer allowing users to get between pages without having to return to the main menu.

Do not use! Work in progress!! Not all nescecary changes implemented yet!!

Major idea of the enhancement is to arrive at a collapsible tree of the table of contents in the drawer (menu items down to a certain level).

(In the master version that has been forked the navigation items are not sorted in the correct order and there is no callapsible tree.)
